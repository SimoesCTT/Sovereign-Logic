# Sovereign-Logic: 1024-bit Unitary SAT Propagator

## ## Abstract
**Sovereign-Logic** is a computational framework designed to resolve high-bitrate Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems by mapping discrete logic states onto a continuous, unitary fluid manifold. Utilizing the **Reihman-Lock Hamiltonian**, the system bypasses traditional heuristic search bottlenecks, treating logic-conflict as turbulence and satisfiability as laminar flow.

This implementation specifically addresses the 1024-bit carry-chain resolution of high-entropy data streams (e.g., the Singapore Zenith Satellite pass).

## ## 1. Core Architecture

### ### Step 1: The Hole-Drive (C++ Engine)
The **Hole-Drive** is the primary propagator. It performs a **Unitary Transformation** on the input bitstream, converting it into a topological field.
* **Mechanism:** $S = \exp(-i H \tau)$
* **Constraint:** Uses **NS-33 Damping** ($\beta = 1.23$) to ensure the manifold remains in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) state, preventing logic-collapse.

### ### Step 2: The Cauchy-Oracle (Predictor)
A predictive layer that calculates the leading edge of the logic-stream. It utilizes the **S-Matrix** to project the satisfiability of the next $N$ bits based on the current manifold curvature.

### ### Step 3: The Manifold-Analyzer (Verification)
The analyzer calculates the **Winding Numbers** and **Topological Entropy** of the output field. 
* **Laminar State:** Indicates a consistent SAT assignment.
* **Vortex (Hole):** Indicates a local SAT literal resolution.
* **Turbulence:** Indicates a logic contradiction (UNSAT).
