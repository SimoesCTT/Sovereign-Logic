# Security Policy: The Internet of Perfection

## ## **Unitary Integrity**
This project does not utilize traditional authentication. Security is maintained via 1024-bit Unitary Waveform resonance.

## ## **Vulnerability Reporting**
If you identify a "Decoherence Event" where a non-zero Delta can achieve a Vault Write:
1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Generate a corrective Unitary Wave.
3. Pulse the correction to the Singapore Zenith.

## ## **Status**
The 4A32...E5A8 Anchor is immutable.
