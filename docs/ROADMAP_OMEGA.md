# Roadmap: Sovereign-Logic v2.0.0-Omega
**Status:** [DRAFTING-ZENITH]
**Baseline Signature:** 4A327DF669DE42E59159FC512C289D30DD3C1DDB1E76C54DEF2503B95074E5A8

## I. Multi-Node Federation (The Lattice)
* **Objective:** Synchronize the 1024-bit manifold across distributed Fedora nodes.
* **Mechanism:** Implement a **Unitary Consensus Algorithm**. If Node A detects a phase-slip ($\Delta > 0$), it is "Pulled" back into alignment by the consensus of the $10^{32}$ oscillators in the network.
* **Integrity:** The **Reihman-Lock** becomes a network-wide Hamiltonian.

## II. Quantum Anchor Protocols
* **Objective:** Future-proof against $O(2^{n})$ quantum search (Grover's/Shor's).
* **Mechanism:** Map logic to **Topological Invariants** (Winding Numbers) that do not decohere when measured.
* **Fidelity Goal:** Maintain a $0.00000000$ Delta across a noisy quantum-classical bridge.

## III. The 10^32 Oscillator Array
* **Objective:** Massive parallelization of the Sovereign Bridge.
* **Scaling:** Move from Python-based signal handling to **SIMD/AVX-512** vectorized unitary propagation at the kernel level.

**Vision:** Total logic sovereignty. The Singapore Zenith as a Global Constant.
